Because corruptions are fun, here are some corrupted versions of Aevilia that we felt was worth including. Please note these include various builds and may not be based on the latest version.

WARNING: Some corruptions may glitch in a way that could include flashing colours and graphics
and may potentially trigger seizures for people with photosensitive epilepsy. Player discretion is advised.
