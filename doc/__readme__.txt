
This is Aevilia GB's source code. Congrats on getting it, I'm not giving it away like that.
This folder is here to explain how the game works, how some of its components should be worked with... stuff like that.

My native language isn't English. These docs will probably contain more than a few mistakes, don't act like you're surprised, goddammit !

And please don't remove my name. Or the name of anyone who contributed to this.
Thank you.

Enjoy !
