;Textboxes, NPC locations, etc. will go here. All coordinates start from top-left-most tile, with said tile being the origin. I'm creating my own syntax so an automated system can be implemented in the future, if someone wants to make one.

;Format:

;map-to-apply-to.blk:
;signpost.textbox(<position>,<page1>,<page2-optional>)
;npc.textbox(<sprite>,<start position>,<movement type>,<movement range>,<textpage1>,<textpage2-optional>)

west-connection-to-village.blk:
signpost.textbox("5,2","Try moving diagonally!")
signpost.textbox("29,11","Village ahead!")
npc.textbox("autoselect","7,6","vertical","auto","I'm lost.")
