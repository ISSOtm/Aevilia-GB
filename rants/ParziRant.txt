Hey. I'm Parzival Wolfram.
Parzival or Parzi for short. 
I'm a new guy to the game-making scene, but I didn't want to start with
a shitty Game Maker fangame or the
like. So I signed up for this. :P
Some of the glorious maps
in this game were made by me.
I'm also the mastermind behind the VC copy.
If you want to contact me, hit
up Glitch City Laboratories
Forums, their Discord or my
email: [REDACTED]
Anyway, I've got a few
greetz to make:

Charmy - stop with the hitler memes.

disrepair - It's not hard to use a VM, I swear.

mikkoku - THE
STACK IS NOT FOR DATA.

Rosetta - Stay stronk! YOU CAN DO
THE RUBIKS CUUUUUUBE

Micropenis (Microsoft) - You can't stop me from
downloading Google
Chrome. I will find a
way.

Megaboys - Demotronic's emucheck still catches some EMUs to this
day. Please release a check
removal patch. It'd make my
life easier (and let me test EMU accuracy!)

TITAN - Check out Genesis Plus GX. 
It is the only emu at the
time of writing that runs Overdrive 2.

Well, I'm tired of tapping this
out on my Galaxy S2, so I shall leave you with a quote:

"WHY THE FUCK IS WINDOWS
UPDATE DISABLED."

Fuck high school. I'm a junior, so I can say that. Anyways, a few more greetz:

JC - You would've been cool in the 80s, but kneehigh socks, beige shorts, a blue camo shirt and a flame doo-rag no longer belong together.

DevEd - Strikeout tags should not be used in all text you type.

Glitchers/Hackers/Modders/cutting-room scroungers:
The game is open-source, but that doesn't mean you're getting access to the build archive. You should've followed development if you wanted 'em for free. Early builds will go from $50 to $200, depending on how old they are. You're not getting the first 5 versions. Ever. 
Official VC builds and anything else other than CGB builds will go for $15 more than the CGB ROM of the same version.

Anyway, time for me to retire for today. I might shit out some more maps.

My school keeps trying to block Tor access. At this point they're just kicking all devices off the public network every hour.
It's just annoying. Not discouraging. They're just pissing all the students off. I'm legit waiting for the riots to start.
Anyway, now to rattle off more names.

Marlin - ffs please just do your fuckin' homework.

Torchickens/ChickasaurusGL - I'm sorry we bastardized your life like we did.

CrashingEchidna - KEEP YOUR BROTHER UNDER CONTROL PLEASE GOOD GOD

K R-B - This is pretty hard. You think making a QR code is hard? You haven't seen anything...

mikkoku (again) - GBz80ASM might not be usable nowadays but it doesn't mean you can't use it as a starting place for x86ASM. So what if they're not the same?

Well, my battery's dying. Time to sign off for now.
Make sure to look for my secret room!
Hint: I messed with collision to make it.
